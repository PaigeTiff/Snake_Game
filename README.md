# Snake_Game

With the help of Udemey's course '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022' I created this Snake game. 

This gave me practice with Animation, Coordinates, Inheritance, and List Slicing with python. 
All files work together to display the snake game video game where the player maneuvers a growing line that becomes primary obstable to itself. Use your up, down, left, right arrows on your key board to control the snake's direction to eat and grow.
